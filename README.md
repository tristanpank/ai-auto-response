# Mia - Mobile Intelligent Assistant
Mia is our design for a new way to receive text messages while you are busy. Rather than sending others a bland text message while you are busy, Mia is there to act as your personal secretary and manage your incoming texts for you. Mia is powered with the technology of OpenAi's Chat GPT-3.5 Turbo API.
